A buyer persona, also known as a customer profile or audience persona, is a semi-fictional representation of your ideal customer. It's derived from market research, real data about your existing customers, and speculations about their behavior, demographics, motivations, and goals. By creating detailed buyer personas, businesses can better understand their audience and tailor their products, services, and marketing strategies to meet the needs and interests of different customer groups.
