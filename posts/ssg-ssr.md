A brand guide is a set of standards that dictate a company's branding strategy. It includes guidelines on how the company's brand should be visually represented, including the correct use of the logo, colors, and typography, as well as the tone of voice in written content.

For your gym business, "Gym Tek," here's a basic outline of what your brand guide might include:

Logo: Showcase your primary and secondary logos. Include guidelines on how to use them, where they should be placed, and any variations that are acceptable (for example, grayscale or black and white versions). Also, specify any minimum size requirements and the spacing that should be maintained around the logo.

Color Palette: Define your primary and secondary color palettes. Include the specific color codes (HEX, RGB, CMYK) so they can be accurately reproduced in digital and print media.

Typography: Specify the fonts to be used in your branding materials. Include primary and secondary fonts for headings, subheadings, and body text. If there are specific font sizes or line spacing to be used, include these as well.

Imagery: Describe the style of images that should be used, whether they're photos, illustrations, or icons. This could include things like the subject matter, composition, color treatment, and so on.

Tone of Voice: This includes guidelines on the tone and style of written content. Is the brand voice formal or informal? Is it friendly, motivational, or authoritative? You can also include examples of do's and don'ts.

Brand Values: Define your core brand values and principles. These should guide all communications and interactions with your customers.

Social Media: Include any specific guidelines for social media, such as profile and cover images, post formats, or hashtags to use.
